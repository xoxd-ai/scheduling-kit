/**
 * FieldMatcher — fuzzy-in for intake fields (design §6 "Intake fields (0.7.0)").
 *
 * Generalizes the required-textarea label inference inlined in
 * `src/adapters/acuity/steps/fill-form.ts` (`fillRequiredTextareas`): the hardcoded
 * keyword chain that maps a textarea's `<label>` text onto a default answer —
 * "work on"/"session" → client notes (else "General wellness"), "sleep" → "7-8 hours",
 * else "N/A". That chain was built "because field ids change when Jen edits the Acuity
 * intake form" (fill-form.ts comment), so the inference keys off label TEXT, not ids.
 *
 * This module turns that ad-hoc `if/else` ladder into shared scoring over label text,
 * shaped as a `FuzzyMatcher<FieldMatchQuery, FieldRule>` exactly like `ServiceMatcher`
 * and `DateMatcher` (value/confidence/strategy/matchedLabel/threshold/alternates),
 * shipping as MACHINERY — a `makeFieldMatcher` factory + `FieldMatcherLive` Layer +
 * `FieldMatcher` Context.Tag. Each rule carries its own keyword set and a `minConfidence`
 * (thresholds are DATA, design §6); the catch-all "N/A" rule is the floor that always
 * admits, so the matcher is total — every label resolves to some answer, with an honest
 * confidence + strategy trail for the journal.
 *
 * The default ruleset is behavior-preserving with the inline ladder: the same labels
 * map to the same answers, now with a confidence score and a runners-up trail.
